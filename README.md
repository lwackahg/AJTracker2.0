## Limitations

### Adaptation Discovery
- The system can only identify potential adaptations when the movie and book titles share similar names
- Adaptations where titles differ significantly (e.g., "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" â†’ "Blade Runner") are outside the scope of this system
- Manual adaptation confirmation is required to ensure accuracy

#### Technical Reasoning
This limitation exists because:
1. Our system relies on string similarity algorithms to match book and movie titles across different APIs (TMDb and Google Books)
2. Creating a comprehensive database of all book-to-movie adaptations would require:
   - Extensive manual curation
   - Complex natural language processing to understand plot similarities
   - Access to detailed metadata beyond what public APIs provide
3. Maintaining such a database would be:
   - Resource-intensive
   - Prone to errors
   - Outside the scope of our current architecture
4. The current approach prioritizes accuracy over completeness - we'd rather miss some adaptations than make incorrect matches
